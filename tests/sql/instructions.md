# SQLite Mini-project

## Description

We're going to complete the CLI we started building in the [previous assignment.](https://github.com/NBHS-STEM/assignments/blob/sols/chinook/injection/insert.py)

Our CLI should allow us to **C**reate, **R**ead, **U**pdate, and **D**elete records *without entering an interactive SQL prompt*. These functions are commonly referred to as **CRUD** and form the backbone of any data storage system.

## Instructions

Complete the attached file `dbcli.py`. The docstrings in each function will tell you how it should work.
